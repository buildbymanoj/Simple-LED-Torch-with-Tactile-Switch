# IC555 LED Dimmer PCB

This is a PCB project designed using KiCad for an LED dimmer circuit using the NE555 timer IC. The brightness of the LED can be controlled using a potentiometer.

## 🎯 Features

- NE555-based PWM dimming circuit
- Adjustable LED brightness using a potentiometer
- Designed for 3.7V DC input
- Discrete component design (easy to assemble)

## 🧰 Components

- NE555P Timer IC
- 5mm LED
- Diodes (D1, D2, D3 - A-405)
- NPN transistor (TO-92 package)
- Potentiometer (Alpha RD901F-40)
- Resistors (1kΩ, 220Ω, etc.)
- Capacitors (100µF, 10µF)
- Battery holder for 3.7V cell

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- KiCad 6+
- DIP & THT footprints for easy prototyping

## 🧪 Status
✅ Circuit tested. LED brightness varies smoothly with the potentiometer.

## 📘 Notes

This project is great for understanding the use of the 555 timer in practical PWM dimming circuits.

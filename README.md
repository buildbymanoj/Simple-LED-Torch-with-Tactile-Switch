# Simple LED Torch PCB

This is a basic PCB project designed using KiCad for a simple LED torch. It is powered by a 3V coin cell (CR2032) and uses a tactile push-button to control an LED through a current-limiting resistor.

## 🔧 Features

- Compact design for handheld use
- Coin cell (CR2032) powered
- Tactile button for on/off control
- Through-hole components for easy soldering
- Ideal for beginners and educational demos

## 📐 Schematic Overview

**Components Used:**
- Battery holder for CR2032 cell
- Tactile switch (Omron B3F series)
- 5mm LED
- 220Ω resistor

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- KiCad 6+
- PCB and schematic layout files included

## 🧪 Status
✅ Tested and working. LED turns on when the button is pressed.
